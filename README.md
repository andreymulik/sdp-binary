# SDP Binary

This is an extension, that provides `Binary` instances for `sdp` structures.

## Reasons

`binary` requires `array` and `container` packages so I can't use it in main
library (one array library mustn't cannot require another array library as a
dependency).

## Versioning

`sdp-binary` follows of the [Haskell PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org) and `sdp`
extension rules.
